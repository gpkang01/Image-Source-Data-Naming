## Image-Source-Data-Naming

1. This program is the naming tool following some defined rules on source data for A.I deep learning.
2. Even if we are using this now, it still has some bugs due to a short development time.
3. This has the function uploading the files that their namings are completed to google drive.
   For this, you should get the file related to token, client_id, etc. at google drive.
   It is located in "setting" folder as "client_secret_drive.json" and "storage.json".
   Due to my privacy, these files have no any content.
4. It doesn't have a function to make "create" folder. But it is necessary for log file.
   Please maintains "create" folder. Or add its code.
5. "up_d_id.txt" file in "setting" folder is for folder key of google driver.
   If you upload files using this program, it will be made automatically like "001|xxx_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx".
   But if you make any folder in manual at google drive, you can add its key at "up_d_id.txt" file.
