## Image-Source-Data-Naming

1. This is the naming tool following some defined rules on source data for A.I deep learning.
2. Even if we are using this now, it still has some bugs due to a short development time.
3. This has the function uploading the files that their namings are completed to google drive.
   For this, you should get the file related to token, client_id, etc. at google drive.
   It is located in setting folder as 'client_secret_drive.json' and storage.json.
   Due to my privacy, these files have no any content.
